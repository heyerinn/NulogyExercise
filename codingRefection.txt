In designing this, I tried to figure out how to calculate the output first to see how the system would flow. 
I considered what variables I have and needed. Initial cost, number of workers needed, and materials involved are given by the user. 
Then the markup percentages are embedded in the program itself.
I thought of having the input be read as a string like “initial cost, number of people, types of materials involved”. 
But I was having trouble in executing it that way so I decided on just asking the input one by one.
